I find that with Zend 2, I have learnt how to use certain design patterns such as MVC and method chaining, I have used this modern framework in one of my previous companies and found it interesting how you could create different factories through service locators.
This framework for me also helped me to enforce PSR-1 and PSR-2 standards when creating method names.

I have used jQuery.validate() libarary to validate form requirements also stripped tags to stop harmul SQL injection going into the database. 

There are magic methods in place for example the Set and Get methods in the Models, to reassure validation for the correct data types.

Unit tests have been used here to test the Model property validation.
